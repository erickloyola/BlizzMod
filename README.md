PLACEHOLDER README:

BlizzMod is a modloader meant to expose relevant IL2CPP functions in Marvel Contest of Champions. In its current state it works, but all functions are located in InitHooks.cpp. A todo item is separating them into cleaner classes and exposing them in API form for actual mods to be written.

I have not included a precompiled binary in the releases yet becauses there are no mods. In order to create a mod, you will need to edit the project directly. You can do that by cloning the repository and editing the functions located in InitHooks.cpp. Soon this repository will be a modloader only and will not need to be edited and I will generate precompiled binaries.

Please check back for the installer project if you are having trouble with Easy Anti Cheat. The patch will be included in the installer, and I don't want to include the patch here. If you are testing the modloader before it's made, send me a message and I'll be happy to tell you how to fix it. It's simple and takes about 5 seconds to do, anyone with half a brain can work around it.

Once you have compiled the project, check the launcher project for how to inject: https://github.com/blizzard25/BlizzModLauncher

TEMPORARY EASY ANTI-CHEAT BYPASS: If you are still looking for a solution to the EOS bypass, the simplest way to bypass is to go into your environment variables, select "New System Variable", and then add "EOS_USE_ANTICHEATCLIENTNULL" with a variable value of 1. This is essentially a debug mode for easy anti cheat, and if not explicitly set (MCOC does not have this explicitly set) allows you to bypass all runtime EOS checks. Now that I've included this publicly, I can't say for how long this will be available, but until i post the full solution, this will work until they choose to fix it. Tested 1/9/26.
